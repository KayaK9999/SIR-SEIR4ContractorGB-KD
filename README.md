## [How to promote the diffusion of green behavior among contractors? Analysis and simulation using the SIR model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723003432)

### abstrat

To promote the green development of the construction industry, improve resource utilization, and mitigate the environmental pollution caused by engineering projects, this study identifies the key paths and influencing factors of behavioral diffusion through the analysis of green behavior diffusion among contractors based on the behavioral decisions of the main participants. The study aims to improve positive influences among contractors with respect to the sustainable development of construction. Using the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, we reconsider contractors of different states; construct state transformation paths for potential adopters, adopters, and abandoners of green behaviors among contractors; and analyze the factors that influence the diffusion of green behaviors among contractors to simulate the effects of different paths of behavior diffusion. The results show that two paths, adoption and recovery rates, have a positive influence on the diffusion of green behavior, while three other paths have a negative influence. The identified factors exhibit two types of influence, promotion and hindrance, involving both intra-firm and government regulations, and are associated with other stakeholders. This study promotes the diffusion of green behavior among contractors, which allows contractors to gain a competitive advantage in advance and has positive implications for the implementation of environmentally friendly concepts in the construction industry.

## [Pathways and State Transfer Laws of Contractors’ Green Knowledge Diffusion Based on SEIR Model](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/9780784485217.022)

### abstrat

Contractors are important participants in achieving sustainable development in the construction industry. Their construction related behaviors in terms of energy-saving and emissions-reduction are guided by green knowledge to continuously improve resource utilization and mitigate environmental impacts through continuous learning. This study analyzes the pathways of green knowledge diffusion in the contractor group based on their knowledge and willingness to transmit green knowledge under the improved SEIR (susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered) model. Further, the study uses simulation experiments to adjust the conversion coefficients to discover the state changes of contractors at different moments and the favorable knowledge diffusion pathways. The results show that the non-informed state is not affected by the conversion coefficient to rapidly shift to other states. The transformations of noninformed to informed, informed to unconcerned, and disseminator to unconcerned are significantly efficient for knowledge diffusion in the group, and knowledge diffusion can spread to the contractor group very fast. This study facilitates the adoption of green behaviors by contractors inspired by green knowledge and promotes green transformation of the construction industry.
