## [How to promote the diffusion of green behavior among contractors? Analysis and simulation using the SIR model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723003432)

To promote the green development of the construction industry, improve resource utilization, and mitigate the environmental pollution caused by engineering projects, this study identifies the key paths and influencing factors of behavioral diffusion through the analysis of green behavior diffusion among contractors based on the behavioral decisions of the main participants. The study aims to improve positive influences among contractors with respect to the sustainable development of construction. Using the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, we reconsider contractors of different states; construct state transformation paths for potential adopters, adopters, and abandoners of green behaviors among contractors; and analyze the factors that influence the diffusion of green behaviors among contractors to simulate the effects of different paths of behavior diffusion. The results show that two paths, adoption and recovery rates, have a positive influence on the diffusion of green behavior, while three other paths have a negative influence. The identified factors exhibit two types of influence, promotion and hindrance, involving both intra-firm and government regulations, and are associated with other stakeholders. This study promotes the diffusion of green behavior among contractors, which allows contractors to gain a competitive advantage in advance and has positive implications for the implementation of environmentally friendly concepts in the construction industry.
